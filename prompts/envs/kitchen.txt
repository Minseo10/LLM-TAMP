The tabletop environment has a robot arm, a sink, a stove, 12 distractors and 6 foods. The robot sits at (0, 0, 0), while positive z-axis points up.
DO NOT move the distractors/sink/stove. They are fixed objects. Only move the foods.

The robot has the following primitive actions, where each primitive action can take a list of objects and parameters as input:
1. pick([obj], {}): pick up obj, with no parameters.
The robot picks up a block obj.
Preconditions: The robot’s arm must be empty.
Effects: the robot is holding obj, and the block is no longer on the table or on the sink/stove.

2.  place([obj], {"x": [-0.625, 0.625], "y": [0.00, 0.65], "z": [0.15, 0.16], "theta": [-3.14, 3.14]}): place obj at location (x, y, z) with planar rotation theta, where x ranges (-0.625, 0.625), y ranges (-0.65, 0.65), z ranges (0.15, 0.16) and theta ranges (-3.14, 3.14).
The robot places a food obj it is holding at a target location.
Preconditions: The position must be clear (no other object at that position).
Effects:
- Placing on the sink: When the food is placed on the sink, then the food is cleaned.
- Placing on the stove: When the food is placed on the stove, then the food is cooked.
- In both cases, after placement the robot’s arm becomes empty, and the robot is no longer holding the block.

The initial environment state is:
{state}

The goal is to cook the given foods.
For a food to be cooked, it must first be cleaned in the sink and then cooked on the stove.
